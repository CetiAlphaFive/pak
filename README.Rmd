pak installs R packages from various sources. It is a replacement for
`install.packages()` and `devtools::install_github()`.
pak is fast, safe and convenient.

## Installation

Install the package from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak_create_private_lib()
```

The second line creates pak's own package library, to avoid interference
between pak's dependencies and the user's regular packages.

## Usage

Simply call `pkg_install()` to install CRAN or BioConductor packages:

```r
pak::pkg_install("usethis")
```

To install GitHub packages, use the `user/repo` syntax:

```r
pak::pkg_install("r-lib/usethis")
```

All dependencies will be installed as well, to the same library.

## Why pak?

### Fast

* Fast downloads and HTTP queries. pak performs all HTTP requests
  concurrently.

* Fast installs. pak builds and installs packages concurrently.

* Metadata and package cache. pak caches package metadata and all downloaded
  packages locally. It does not download the same package files over and
  over again.

* Lazy installation. pak only installs the packages that are really needed
  to be installed. If the requested package and its dependencies are
  already installed, pak does nothing.

### Safe

* Private library (pak's own package dependencies do not affect your
  regular package libraries and vice versa).

* Dependency solver. pak makes sure that you end up in a consistent, working
  state of dependencies. It finds conflicts up front, before actually
  installing anything. pak fixes installations, i.e. if a downsteam
  dependency is missing, it installs it, even if the requested package is
  already installed.

* pak avoids loading packages from your regular package libraries.
  These package files would be locked on some systems, and locked packages
  cannot be updated. pak does not load any package in the main process
  (except for pak itself). Every pak operation runs in a sub-process, and
  the packages are loaded from the private library.

* To avoid updating locked packages, pak warns and requests confirmation
  for loaded packages.

### Convenient

* BioC packages. pak supports BioConductor packages out of the box. It
  uses the BioConductor version that is appropriate for your R version.

* GitHub packages. pak supports GitHub packages out of the box. It also
  supports the `Remotes` entry in `DESCRIPTION` files (see e.g.
  https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/remotes/vignettes/dependencies.html).

* Package sizes. For CRAN packages pak shows the total sizes of packages
  it needs to download.
